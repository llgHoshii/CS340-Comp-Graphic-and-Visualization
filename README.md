* How do I approach designing software?

This project helped me be more aware of code organization and how modularizing segments of code can be beneficial.
Moving forward i will desing software with this approach in mind.
Software for me is like cooking, there is no one right way of doing something, so when i design i like to be creative and explore different solutions before deciding on one and that is what i did in this project. I explored different ways objects can be rendered and how certain textures can be obtained. This is seen in my use of cylinders instead of a torus and how the books are texturized.
Overall this project had a very steep learning curve but after that it all made sense. The hardest parts were redering multiple objects and lighting.
I would say this project gave me a better understading of the C languange and how a state machine works.

* How do I approach developing programs?
My approach evolved a lot when developing this project. At first i wanted to understand every little detail about how the code worked and what could be done with it but i quickly realized i wasnt understanding it and instead i should tinker with it and test my ideas out.
I also began by wanting to create the objects with their final iteration in mind, which i now see as a waste of effort becasue they would be constantly changing.
Intead of doing that i changed my approach to simply create the the primitave shape of the obejct and place it somewhere in the world. This led to the challenge of rendering multiple objects and understanding how that segment of the code worked.
The new development strategy i learned and used was to not try and understand it all but understand little by little. I first began understanding how to create primitive shapes which led me to understand about rendering multiple objects and in future iterations of the objects i understood more about textures, lighting, placement, etc.

* How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
This course helped me develop new strategies when creating and understanding code.
Having the ability to view problems in a new angle and taking each problem one at a time are extremely beneficial in a educational and professional setting.
It also gave me a deeper understanding of how code works and what it is capable of which in turn will make future projects easier to develop.
I can also apply these new neural pathways to other areas of my life such as personal problem solving and tackling daunting tasks with many moving parts.
